A custom weapon maker for R5 Reloaded. 
100% gonna be issues here and there. If you find some then DM Average User.#5826 on discord.
You need some basic knowledge. This ain't gonna do the prechaching, dev menu, or JANU's Framework but it will
give you the following stuff you need. This mainly is to create a shell of a weapon you can do more with if you have the knowledge.
Please enjoy I put alot of effort into this.
